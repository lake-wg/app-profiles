# Introduction # {#intro}

Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC) {{RFC9528}} is a lightweight authenticated key exchange protocol, especially intended for use in constrained scenarios. A main use case for EDHOC is to establish a Security Context for Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE) {{RFC8613}}.

In order to successfully run EDHOC, the two peers acting as Initiator and Responder have to agree on certain parameters. Some of those are in-band and communicated through the protocol execution, during which a few of them may even be negotiated. However, other parameters have to be known out-of-band, before running the EDHOC protocol.

As discussed in {{Section 3.9 of RFC9528}}, applications can use EDHOC application profiles, which specify the intended usage of EDHOC to allow for the relevant processing and verifications to be made. In particular, an EDHOC application profile may include both in-band and out-of-band parameters.

In order to ensure the applicability of such parameters and information beyond transport- or setup-specific scenarios, this document also defines the EDHOC_Application_Profile object, i.e., a canonical, CBOR-based representation that can be used to describe, distribute, and store EDHOC application profiles as CBOR data items (see {{sec-app-profile-cbor}}). The defined representation is transport- and setup-independent, and avoids the need to reinvent an encoding for the available options to run the EDHOC protocol or the selection logic to apply on those.

The CBOR-based representation of an EDHOC application profile can be, for example: retrieved as a result of a discovery process; or retrieved/provided during the retrieval/provisioning of an EDHOC peer's public authentication credential; or obtained during the execution of a device on-boarding/registration workflow.

Furthermore, in order to facilitate interoperability between EDHOC implementations and to support EDHOC extensibility for additional integrations (e.g., of external security applications, handling of authentication credentials, and message transports), this document defines a number of means to coordinate the use of EDHOC application profiles, that is:

* The new IANA registry "EDHOC Application Profiles" defined in {{iana-edhoc-application-profiles}}, where to register integer identifiers of EDHOC application profiles to use as corresponding Profile IDs.

* The new parameter "ed-prof" defined in {{web-linking}}. This parameter is employed to specify an EDHOC application profile identified by its Profile ID and can be used as target attribute in a web link {{RFC8288}} to an EDHOC resource, or as filter criterion in a discovery request to discover EDHOC resources.

  For instance, the target attribute can be used in a link-format document {{RFC6690}} describing EDHOC resources at a server, when EDHOC is transferred over the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) {{RFC7252}} (see {{Section A.2 of RFC9528}} as well as {{RFC9668}}).

* The new parameter "app_prof" defined in {{sec-edhoc-information-object}} for the EDHOC_Information object specified in {{I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile}}. This parameter is employed to specify a set of EDHOC application profiles, each identified by its Profile ID.

  For instance, the parameter can be used in the EDHOC and OSCORE profile {{I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile}} of the ACE framework for authentication and authorization in constrained environments (ACE) {{RFC9200}}, in order to indicate the EDHOC application profiles supported by an ACE resource server.

  This parameter is also used in the EDHOC_Application_Profile object defined in this document, in order to encode the Profile ID of the EDHOC application profile described by an instance of that object.

* Additional parameters that provide information about an EDHOC application profile. These parameters correspond to elements of the EDHOC_Information object and are to be used as target attributes in a web link to an EDHOC resource, or as filter criteria in a discovery request to discover EDHOC resources (see {{sec-parameters-web-linking}}).

* A new EDHOC External Authorization Data (EAD) item (see {{sec-app-profile-edhoc-message_1_2}}) and a new error code for the EDHOC error message (see {{sec-app-profile-edhoc-error-message}}). When running EDHOC, a peer can use those in order to advertise the EDHOC application profiles that it supports to the other peer.

* The use of SVCB Resource Records (RR) {{RFC9460}}{{RFC9461}} to advertise the support for EDHOC and for EDHOC application profiles of a given server (see {{sec-svcb}}).

Finally, this document defines a set of well-known EDHOC application profiles (see {{sec-well-known-app-profiles}}). These application profiles are meant to reflect what is most common and expected to be supported by EDHOC peers, while they are not to be intended as "default" application profiles or as a deviation from what is mandatory to support for EDHOC peers (see {{Section 8 of RFC9528}}). On the other hand, they provide implementers and users with a quick overview of the several available options to run the EDHOC protocol and of their most expected combinations.

## Terminology ## {#terminology}

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

The reader is expected to be familiar with terms and concepts defined in EDHOC {{RFC9528}}, and with the use of EDHOC with CoAP {{RFC7252}} and OSCORE {{RFC8613}} defined in {{RFC9668}}.

Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) {{RFC8949}} and Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL) {{RFC8610}} are used in this document. CDDL predefined type names, especially bstr for CBOR byte strings and tstr for CBOR text strings, are used extensively in this document.

CBOR data items are represented using the CBOR extended diagnostic notation as defined in {{Section 8 of RFC8949}} and {{Section G of RFC8610}} ("diagnostic notation"). Diagnostic notation comments are used to provide a textual representation of the parameters' keys and values.

In the CBOR diagnostic notation used in this document, constructs of the form e'SOME_NAME' are replaced by the value assigned to SOME_NAME in the CDDL model shown in {{fig-cddl-model}} of {{sec-cddl-model}}. For example, {e'methods' : \[0, 1, 2, 3\], e'cipher_suites': 3} stands for {1 : \[0, 1, 2, 3\], 2 : 3}.

Note to RFC Editor: Please delete the paragraph immediately preceding this note. Also, in the CBOR diagnostic notation used in this document, please replace the constructs of the form e'SOME_NAME' with the value assigned to SOME_NAME in the CDDL model shown in {{fig-cddl-model}} of {{sec-cddl-model}}. Finally, please delete this note.

# EDHOC\_Application\_Profile # {#sec-app-profile-cbor}

This section defines the EDHOC_Application_Profile object, which can be used as a canonical representation of EDHOC application profiles for their description, distribution, and storage.

An EDHOC_Application_Profile object is encoded as a CBOR map {{RFC8949}}. All elements that can be included in the EDHOC_Application_Profile object are elements that can be included in the CBOR-encoded EDHOC_Information object specified in {{Section 3.4 of I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile}}. In particular, they use the same CBOR abbreviations from the 'CBOR label' column of the IANA registry "EDHOC Information" defined in {{I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile}}.

By construction, an EDHOC_Application_Profile object conveys information that pertains to the execution of EDHOC. This includes, e.g., information about transporting and processing EDHOC messages during an EDHOC session. An EDHOC_Application_Profile object does not convey information that does not play a role in completing an EDHOC execution. For instance, this includes the size of outputs of the EDHOC_Exporter interface (see {{Section 4.2.1 of RFC9528}}), or properties and features of protocols other than EDHOC itself that build on the results from an EDHOC session (e.g., the version of the application protocol subsequently used).

The CBOR map encoding an EDHOC_Application_Profile object MUST include the element "app_prof" defined in {{sec-edhoc-information-object}} of this document, as well as the elements "methods" and "cred_types" defined in {{Section 3.4 of I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile}}.

The value of the element "app_prof" is the unique identifier of the EDHOC application profile described by the instance of the EDHOC_Application_Profile object in question. The identifier is taken from the 'Profile ID' column of the "EDHOC Application Profiles" registry defined in this document and encoded as a CBOR integer.

The CBOR map MUST NOT include the following elements: "session_id", "uri_path", "initiator", "responder", and "trust_anchors". A consumer MUST ignore those elements if they are included in the EDHOC_Application_Profile object.

The CBOR map MAY include other elements.

Furthermore, consistent with {{Sections 8 and A.1 of RFC9528}} and with {{Section 5.4 of RFC8613}}, the following applies:

* If the element "cipher_suites" is not present in the CBOR map, this indicates that the EDHOC application profile uses the EDHOC cipher suites 2 and 3, and possibly other cipher suites.

* If the element "id_cred_types" is not present in the CBOR map, this indicates that the EDHOC application profile uses "kid" as type of authentication credential identifiers for EDHOC, and possibly other types of authentication credential identifiers.

* The absence of any other elements in the CBOR map MUST NOT result in assuming any value.

If an element is present in the CBOR map and the corresponding entry in the IANA registry "EDHOC Information" specifies "NP" (non-prescriptive) in the 'Type' column and "True or False" in the 'CBOR type' column, then the following applies. An EDHOC peer that adheres to the EDHOC application profile in question is required or not to support the property or feature of EDHOC associated with the element in the CBOR map, if that element encodes the CBOR simple value `true` (0xf5) or `false` (0xf4), respectively. For example, the presence of the parameter "comb_req" denotes whether EDHOC peers adhering to the EDHOC application profile have to support the EDHOC + OSCORE combined request defined in {{RFC9668}}, or instead do not have to but might if they are willing to.

If an element present in the CBOR map specifies an information that is intrinsically a set of one or more co-existing alternatives, then all the specified alternatives apply for the EDHOC application profile in question. For example, the element "cipher_suites" with value the CBOR array \[0, 2\] means that, in order to adhere to the EDHOC application profile in question, an EDHOC peer has to implement both the EDHOC cipher suites 0 and 2, because either of them can be used by another EDHOC peer also adhering to the same EDHOC application profile.

The CDDL grammar describing the EDHOC_Application_Profile object is:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ CDDL
EDHOC_Application_Profile = {
      1 => int / array,    ; methods
      6 => int / array,    ; cred_types
     23 => int,            ; app_prof
   * int / tstr => any
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# Identifying EDHOC Application Profiles by Profile ID

This document introduces the concept of Profile IDs, i.e., integer values that uniquely identify EDHOC application profiles, for which an IANA registry is defined in {{iana-edhoc-application-profiles}}.

This section defines two parameters to convey such Profile IDs, i.e.:

* The parameter "ed-prof" for web linking {{RFC8288}} (see {{web-linking}}).

* The parameter "app_prof" of the EDHOC_Information object specified in {{I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile}} (see {{sec-edhoc-information-object}}).

  As defined in {{sec-app-profile-cbor}}, Profile IDs are also conveyed by the parameter "app_prof" in the EDHOC_Application_Profile object, in order to identify the EDHOC application profile described by a given instance of that object.

As defined later in this document, Profile IDs can be used to identify EDHOC application profiles also:

* Within certain EDHOC messages sent during an EDHOC session by a peer that supports such EDHOC application profiles (see {{sec-app-profile-edhoc-messages}}).

* When using SVCB Resource Records (RR) {{RFC9460}}{{RFC9461}} to advertise the support for EDHOC and for EDHOC application profiles of a given server (see {{sec-svcb}}).

## In Web Linking # {#web-linking}

{{Section 6 of RFC9668}} defines a number of target attributes that can be used in a web link {{RFC8288}} with resource type "core.edhoc" (see {{Section 10.10 of RFC9528}}). This is the case, e.g., when using a link-format document {{RFC6690}} describing EDHOC resources at a server, when EDHOC is transferred over CoAP {{RFC7252}} as defined in {{Section A.2 of RFC9528}}. This allows a client to obtain relevant information about the EDHOC application profile(s) to be used with a certain EDHOC resource.

In the same spirit, this section defines the following additional parameter, which can be optionally specified as a target attribute with the same name in the link to the respective EDHOC resource, or among the filter criteria in a discovery request from a client.

* 'ed-prof', specifying an EDHOC application profile supported by the server. This parameter MUST specify a single value, which is taken from the 'Profile ID' column of the "EDHOC Application Profiles" registry defined in {{iana-edhoc-application-profiles}} of this document. This parameter MAY occur multiple times, with each occurrence specifying an EDHOC application profile.

When specifying the parameter 'ed-prof' in a link to an EDHOC resource, the target attribute rt="core.edhoc" MUST be included.

If a link to an EDHOC resource includes occurrences of the target attribute 'ed-prof', then the following applies.

* The link MUST NOT include other target attributes that provide information about an EDHOC application profile (see, e.g., {{Section 6 of RFC9668}} and {{sec-parameters-web-linking}} of this document), with the exception of the target attribute 'ed-ead' that MAY be included.

  The recipient MUST ignore other target attributes that provide information about an EDHOC application profile, with the exception of the target attribute 'ed-ead'.

* If the link includes occurrences of the target attribute 'ed-ead', the link provides the following information: when using the target EDHOC resource as per the EDHOC application profile indicated by any occurrence of the target attribute 'ed-prof', the server supports the External Authorization Data (EAD) items that are specified in the definition of that EDHOC application profile, as well as the EAD items indicated by the occurrences of the target attribute 'ed-ead'.

The example in {{fig-web-link-example}} shows how a CoAP client discovers two EDHOC resources at a CoAP server, and obtains information about the application profile corresponding to each of those resources. The Link Format notation from {{Section 5 of RFC6690}} is used.

The example assumes the existence of an EDHOC application profile identified by the integer Profile ID 500, which is supported by the EDHOC resource at /edhoc-alt and whose definition includes the support for the EAD items with EAD label 111 and 222.

Therefore, the link to the EDHOC resource at /edhoc-alt indicates that, when using that EDHOC resource as per the EDHOC application profile with Profile ID 500, the server supports the EAD items with EAD label 111, 222, and 333.

## In the EDHOC_Information Object # {#sec-edhoc-information-object}

{{Section 3.4 of I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile}} defines the EDHOC_Information object, as including information that guides two peers towards executing the EDHOC protocol, and defines an initial set of its parameters.

This document defines the new parameter "app\_prof" of the EDHOC_Information object, as summarized in {{table-cbor-key-edhoc-params}} and described further below.

| Name     | CBOR label | CBOR type    | Registry                            | Description                                 |
| app_prof | 23         | int or array | EDHOC Application Profiles Registry | Set of supported EDHOC Application Profiles |
{: #table-cbor-key-edhoc-params title="EDHOC_Information Parameter \"app_prof\"" align="center"}

* app\_prof: This parameter specifies a set of supported EDHOC application profiles, identified by their Profile ID. If the set is composed of a single EDHOC application profile, its Profile ID is encoded as an integer. Otherwise, the set is encoded as an array of integers, where each array element encodes one Profile ID. In JSON, the "app\_prof" value is an integer or an array of integers. In CBOR, "app\_prof" is an integer or an array of integers, and has label 23. The integer values are taken from the 'Profile ID' column of the "EDHOC Application Profiles" registry defined in {{iana-edhoc-application-profiles}} of this document.

### Use in the EDHOC and OSCORE Profile of the ACE Framework

{{Section 3 of I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile}} defines how the EDHOC_Information object can be used within the workflow of the EDHOC and OSCORE transport profile of the ACE framework for authentication and authorization in constrained environments (ACE) {{RFC9200}}.

In particular, the AS-to-C Access Token Response includes the parameter "edhoc_info", with value an EDHOC_Information object. This allows the ACE authorization server (AS) to provide the ACE client (C) with information about how to run the EDHOC protocol with the ACE resource server (RS) for which the access token is issued.

Similarly, the access token includes the corresponding claim "edhoc_info", with value an EDHOC_Information object. This allows the AS to provide the ACE RS with information about how to run the EDHOC protocol with the ACE client, according to the issued access token.

In turn, the EDHOC_Information object can include the parameter "app_prof" defined in this document. This parameter indicates a set of EDHOC application profiles associated with the EDHOC resource to use at the RS, which is either implied or specified by the parameter "uri_path" within the same EDHOC_Information object.

If the EDHOC_Information object specified as value of "edhoc_info" includes the "app_prof" parameter, then the following applies.

* The object MUST NOT include other parameters, with the following exceptions:

  * The parameter "eads".

  * The parameters that are not allowed in the EDHOC\_Application\_Profile object defined in {{sec-app-profile-cbor}}.

    These include the parameter "session_id", which the EDHOC_Information object has to include (see {{Sections 3.3 and 3.3.1 of I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile}}).

  C and RS MUST ignore other parameters that are not admitted if they are present in the EDHOC_Information object.

* The object might provide an information that corresponds to an EDHOC_Information prescriptive parameter (see {{Section 3.4 of I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile}}), e.g., "message_4" or "max_msgsize". The type of a parameter is indicated in the 'Type' column of the corresponding entry in the IANA registry "EDHOC Information" (see {{I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile}}).

  If the object specifies such an information multiple times, then each occurrence of that information MUST convey exactly the same content. This MUST take into account prescriptive parameters that are included: i) as elements of the EDHOC_Information object; or ii) as elements of an EDHOC_Application_Profile object (see {{sec-app-profile-cbor}}) encoding an EDHOC application profile, which is identified by its Profile ID specified in the "app_prof" parameter of the EDHOC_Information object.

  A consumer MUST treat as malformed an EDHOC_Information object that does not comply with the restriction above.

* If the EDHOC_Information object specified in the parameter "edhoc_info" of the AS-to-C Access Token Response includes the parameter "eads", then the following applies.

  When using the target EDHOC resource as per any EDHOC application profile indicated by the parameter "app_prof", the ACE RS for which the access token is issued supports the EAD items that are specified in the definition of that EDHOC application profile, as well as the EAD items indicated by the parameter "eads".

* If the EDHOC_Information object specified in the claim "edhoc_info" of the access token includes the parameter "eads", then the following applies.

  When using the target EDHOC resource as per any EDHOC application profile indicated by the parameter "app_prof", the ACE client to which the access token is issued supports the EAD items that are specified in the definition of that EDHOC application profile, as well as the EAD items indicated by the parameter "eads".

# Additional Parameters for Web Linking # {#sec-parameters-web-linking}

Building on what is defined and prescribed in {{Section 6 of RFC9668}}, this section defines additional parameters for web linking {{RFC8288}}, which can be used to obtain relevant pieces of information from the EDHOC application profile associated with an EDHOC resource.

These parameters can be optionally specified as target attributes with the same name in a link with resource type "core.edhoc" (see {{Section 10.10 of RFC9528}}) targeting an EDHOC resource, or as filter criteria in a discovery request from a client.

When specifying any of the parameters defined below in a link to an EDHOC resource, the target attribute rt="core.edhoc" MUST be included.

* 'ed-max-msgsize', specifying the admitted maximum size of EDHOC messages in bytes. This parameter MUST specify a single unsigned integer value.

* 'ed-coap-ct', specifying that CoAP messages have to include the CoAP Content-Format Option with value 64 (application/edhoc+cbor-seq) or 65 (application/cid-edhoc+cbor-seq) as appropriate, when the message payload includes exclusively an EDHOC message possibly prepended by an EDHOC connection identifier (see {{Sections 3.4.1 and A.2 of RFC9528}}). A value MUST NOT be given to this parameter and any present value MUST be ignored by the recipient.

* 'ed-epid-t', specifying a type of endpoint identity for EDHOC supported by the server. This parameter MUST specify a single value, which is taken from the 'CBOR Label' column of the "EDHOC Endpoint Identity Types" registry defined in {{I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile}}. This parameter MAY occur multiple times, with each occurrence specifying a type of endpoint identity for EDHOC.

* 'ed-tp', specifying a means for transporting EDHOC messages supported by the server. This parameter MUST specify a single value, which is taken from the 'Transport ID' column of the "EDHOC Transports" registry defined in {{I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile}}. This parameter MAY occur multiple times, with each occurrence specifying a means for transporting EDHOC messages.

* 'ed-ta-edcred-uuid', specifying the identifier of a trust anchor supported by the server for verifying authentication credentials of other EDHOC peers, as a UUID {{RFC9562}}. This parameter MUST specify a single value, which is the UUID in its string format (see Section 4 of {{RFC9562}}). This parameter MAY occur multiple times, with each occurrence specifying one trust anchor identifier.

* 'ed-ta-edcred-kid', specifying the identifier of a trust anchor supported by the server for verifying authentication credentials of other EDHOC peers, as a binary key identifier. This parameter MUST specify a single value, which is the base64url-encoded text string of the binary representation of the key identifier. This parameter MAY occur multiple times, with each occurrence specifying one trust anchor identifier.

* 'ed-ta-edcred-c5t', specifying the identifier of a trust anchor supported by the server for verifying authentication credentials of other EDHOC peers, as a hash of a C509 certificate {{I-D.ietf-cose-cbor-encoded-cert}}. This parameter MUST specify a single value, which is the base64url-encoded text string of the binary representation of the certificate hash encoded as a COSE_CertHash {{RFC9360}}. This parameter MAY occur multiple times, with each occurrence specifying one trust anchor identifier.

* 'ed-ta-edcred-c5u', specifying the identifier of a trust anchor supported by the server for verifying authentication credentials of other EDHOC peers, as a URI {{RFC3986}} pointing to a C509 certificate {{I-D.ietf-cose-cbor-encoded-cert}}. This parameter MUST specify a single value, which is the URI pointing to the certificate. This parameter MAY occur multiple times, with each occurrence specifying one trust anchor identifier.

* 'ed-ta-edcred-x5t', specifying the identifier of a trust anchor supported by the server for verifying authentication credentials of other EDHOC peers, as a hash of an X.509 certificate {{RFC5280}}. This parameter MUST specify a single value, which is the base64url-encoded text string of the binary representation of the certificate hash encoded as a COSE_CertHash {{RFC9360}}. This parameter MAY occur multiple times, with each occurrence specifying one trust anchor identifier.

* 'ed-ta-edcred-x5u', specifying the identifier of a trust anchor supported by the server for verifying authentication credentials of other EDHOC peers, as a URI {{RFC3986}} pointing to an X.509 certificate {{RFC5280}}. This parameter MUST specify a single value, which is the URI pointing to the certificate. This parameter MAY occur multiple times, with each occurrence specifying one trust anchor identifier.

# Advertising Supported EDHOC Application Profiles during an EDHOC Session # {#sec-app-profile-edhoc-messages}

The rest of this section defines means that an EDHOC peer can use in order to advertise the EDHOC application profiles that it supports to another EDHOC peer, when running EDHOC with that other peer.

Such means are an EDHOC EAD item (see {{sec-app-profile-edhoc-message_1_2}}) and an error code for the EDHOC error message (see {{sec-app-profile-edhoc-error-message}}).

## In EDHOC Message 1 and Message 2 # {#sec-app-profile-edhoc-message_1_2}

This section defines the EDHOC EAD item "Supported EDHOC application profiles", which is registered in {{iana-edhoc-ead-registry}} of this document.

The EAD item MAY be included:

* In the EAD_1 field of EDHOC message_1, in order to specify EDHOC application profiles supported by the Initiator.

* In the EAD_2 field of EDHOC message_2, in order to specify EDHOC application profiles supported by the Responder.

When the EAD item is present, its ead_label TBD_EAD_LABEL MUST be used only with negative sign, i.e., the use of the EAD item is always critical (see {{Section 3.8 of RFC9528}}).

The EAD item MUST NOT occur more than once in the EAD fields of EDHOC message_1 or message_2. The recipient peer MUST abort the EDHOC session and MUST reply with an EDHOC error message if the EAD item occurs multiple times in the EAD fields of EDHOC message_1 or message_2.

The EAD item MUST NOT be included in the EAD fields of EDHOC message_3 or message_4. In case the recipient peer supports the EAD item, the recipient peer MUST silently ignore the EAD item if this is included in the EAD fields of EDHOC message_3 or message_4.

The EAD item MUST specify an ead_value, as a CBOR byte string with value the binary representation of a CBOR sequence {{RFC8742}}, namely APP_PROF_SEQ. The CBOR sequence is composed of one or more items, whose order has no meaning.

Each item of the CBOR sequence MUST be either of the following:

* A CBOR integer, specifying the Profile ID of an EDHOC application profile. The integer value is taken from the 'Profile ID' column of the "EDHOC Application Profiles" registry defined in {{iana-edhoc-application-profiles}} of this document.

  This item of the CBOR sequence indicates that the message sender supports the EDHOC application profile identified by the Profile ID.

* A CBOR array including at least one element. In particular:

  * The first element MUST be a CBOR integer, specifying the Profile ID of an EDHOC application profile. The integer value is taken from the 'Profile ID' column of the "EDHOC Application Profiles" registry.

  * Each of the elements following the first one MUST be a CBOR unsigned integer, specifying the ead_label of an EAD item.

  This item of the CBOR sequence indicates that the message sender supports:

  * The EDHOC application profile PROFILE identified by the Profile ID in the first element of the array; and

  * The EAD items identified by the ead_label in the elements following the first one, in addition to the EAD items that are specified in the definition of the EDHOC application profile PROFILE.

* An EDHOC_Information object encoded in CBOR, i.e., as a CBOR map (see {{Section 3.4 of I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile}}).

  The EDHOC_Information object MUST NOT include the element "app_prof" and MUST NOT include elements that are not allowed within the EDHOC_Application_Profile object defined in {{sec-app-profile-cbor}}, with the exception of the element "trust_anchor" that MAY be included. The recipient peer MUST ignore elements that are not allowed if they are present in the EDHOC_Information object.

  This item of the CBOR sequence indicates that the message sender supports an EDHOC application profile consistent with the pieces of information specified by the EDHOC_Information object.

When composing ead_value, the sender peer MUST comply with the content restrictions specified in {{sec-app-profile-edhoc-message_1_2-restrictions}}.

The recipient peer MUST abort the EDHOC session and MUST reply with an EDHOC error message if ead_value is malformed or does not conform with the format defined above.

The CDDL grammar describing ead_value for the EAD item "Supported EDHOC application profiles" is shown in {{fig-cddl-ead-value}}.

; are to be used in the CBOR Sequence APP_PROF_SEQ:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
{: #fig-cddl-ead-value title="CDDL Definition of ead_value for the EAD item \"Supported EDHOC application profiles\"" artwork-align="left"}

### Content Restrictions # {#sec-app-profile-edhoc-message_1_2-restrictions}

When the sender peer composes ead_value of the EDHOC EAD item "Supported EDHOC application profiles", the following applies.

It is possible that ead_value provides an information that corresponds to an EDHOC_Information prescriptive parameter (see {{Section 3.4 of I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile}}), e.g., "message_4" or "max_msgsize". The type of such a parameter is indicated in the 'Type' column of the corresponding entry in the IANA registry "EDHOC Information" (see {{I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile}}).

If ead_value specifies such an information multiple times, then each occurrence of that information MUST convey exactly the same content. With reference to the CBOR sequence APP_PROF_SEQ defined in {{sec-app-profile-edhoc-message_1_2}}, the enforcement of these content restrictions MUST take into account prescriptive parameters that are included:

* As elements of an EDHOC_Information object specified within APP_PROF_SEQ; or

* As elements of an EDHOC_Application_Profile object encoding an EDHOC application profile, which is identified by its Profile ID specified within APP_PROF_SEQ.

If the Responder receives the EAD item in the EAD_1 field of EDHOC message_1 and intends to include the EAD item in the EAD_2 field of EDHOC message_2, then the Responder MUST further take into account the presence of such information in the received EAD item when composing ead_value.

A consumer MUST treat as malformed an EDHOC_Information object that does not comply with the restrictions above.

## In the EDHOC Error Message # {#sec-app-profile-edhoc-error-message}

This section defines the error code TBD_ERROR_CODE, which is registered in {{iana-edhoc-error-codes-registry}} of this document.

Error code TBD_ERROR_CODE MUST only be used when replying to EDHOC message_1. If an EDHOC error message with error code TBD_ERROR_CODE is received as reply to an EDHOC message different from EDHOC message_1, then the recipient of the error message MUST ignore what is specified in ERR_INFO.

The Responder MUST NOT abort an EDHOC session exclusively due to the wish of sending an error message with error code TBD_ERROR_CODE. Instead, the Responder can advertise the EDHOC application profiles that it supports to the Initiator by means of the EAD item "Supported EDHOC application profiles" defined in {{sec-app-profile-edhoc-message_1_2}}, specifying it in the EAD_2 field of the EDHOC message_2 to send in the EDHOC session.

When replying to an EDHOC message_1 with an error message, the Responder has to consider the reason for which it is aborting the EDHOC session and MUST NOT specify error code TBD_ERROR_CODE if a different, more appropriate error code can be specified instead. For example, if the negotiation of the selected cipher suite fails (see {{Section 6.3 of RFC9528}}), the error message MUST NOT specify error code TBD_ERROR_CODE, since the error message intended to be used in that case specifies error code 2 (Wrong selected cipher suite) and conveys SUITES_R as ERR_INFO.

When using error code TBD_ERROR_CODE, the error information specified in ERR_INFO MUST be a CBOR byte string with value the binary representation of a CBOR sequence APP_PROF_SEQ. This CBOR sequence has the same format and semantics of the one used for ead_value of the EAD item "Supported EDHOC application profiles" (see {{sec-app-profile-edhoc-message_1_2}}).

The recipient peer MUST silently ignore elements of the CBOR sequence APP_PROF_SEQ that are malformed or do not conform with the intended format.

# Advertising Supported EDHOC Application Profiles using SVCB Resource Records # {#sec-svcb}

Given a server, its support for EDHOC and for EDHOC application profiles can be advertised using SVCB Resource Records (RR) {{RFC9460}}{{RFC9461}}.

To this end, this document specifies the SvcParamKeys "edhocpath" and "edhoc-app-prof", which are defined below and are registered in {{iana-svcb}}.

* "edhocpath" - The SvcParamKey "edhocpath" is single-valued and its value MUST be a CBOR data item PATH_OUTER, which MUST be a CBOR byte string PATH_BSTR or a CBOR array. In the latter case, the array MUST include at least two elements, each of which MUST be a CBOR byte string PATH_BSTR. The SVCB RR MUST be considered malformed if the SvcParamValue ends within PATH_OUTER or if PATH_OUTER is malformed.

  The value of each CBOR byte string PATH_BSTR is the binary representation of a CBOR sequence PATH_SEQ composed of zero or more CBOR text strings. In particular, each PATH_SEQ specifies the URI path of an EDHOC resource at the server, with each CBOR text string within that PATH_SEQ specifying a URI path segment.

  The CDDL grammar describing the value of the SvcParamKey "edhocpath" is shown in {{fig-cddl-edhocpath-value}}.

  Editor's note: consider to add the same explanation about the chosen encoding for the URI path as a CBOR sequence that is given in Section 3.2 of draft-ietf-core-dns-over-coap-15.

* "edhoc-app-prof" - The SvcParamKey "edhoc-app-prof" is single-valued and its value MUST be a CBOR data item APP_OUTER, which MUST be a CBOR byte string APP_BSTR or a CBOR array. In the latter case, the array MUST include at least two elements, each of which MUST be a CBOR byte string APP_BSTR. The SVCB RR MUST be considered malformed if the SvcParamValue ends within APP_OUTER or if APP_OUTER is malformed.

  The value of each CBOR byte string APP_BSTR is the binary representation of a CBOR sequence APP_PROF_SEQ, which has the same format and semantics specified in {{sec-app-profile-edhoc-message_1_2}}. The SVCB RR MUST be considered malformed if APP_PROF_SEQ is malformed or does not conform with the format defined in {{sec-app-profile-edhoc-message_1_2}}.

  The CDDL grammar describing the value of the SvcParamKey "edhoc-app-prof" is shown in {{fig-cddl-edhoc-app-prof-value}}.

  Each CBOR sequence APP_PROF_SEQ specifies a set of EDHOC application profiles that the server supports.

If the SvcParamKey "edhoc-app-prof" is not present in the SVCB RR, then the SvcParamKey "edhocpath", if present, specifies the URI paths of EDHOC resources at the server.

If the SvcParamKey "edhoc-app-prof" is present in the SVCB RR, then the following applies.

* If the SvcParamKey "edhocpath" is not present in the SVCB RR, then the value of the SvcParamKey "edhoc-app-prof" MUST be a CBOR byte string.

  The information specified by the SvcParamKey "edhoc-app-prof" pertains to the EDHOC resource at the server with URI path "/.well-known/edhoc".

* If the SvcParamKey "edhocpath" is present in the SVCB RR, then the following applies.

  * If the value of the SvcParamKey "edhocpath" is a CBOR byte string, then the value of the SvcParamKey "edhoc-app-prof" MUST also be a CBOR byte string.

    The information specified by the SvcParamKey "edhoc-app-prof" pertains to the EDHOC resource at the server with URI path specified by the SvcParamKey "edhocpath".

  * If the value of the SvcParamKey "edhocpath" is a CBOR array including N elements, then the value of the SvcParamKey "edhoc-app-prof" MUST also be a CBOR array including N elements.

    The information specified by the i-th element of the CBOR array within the SvcParamKey "edhoc-app-prof" pertains to the EDHOC resource at the server with URI path specified by the i-th element of the CBOR array within the SvcParamKey "edhocpath".

A consumer MUST treat as malformed an SVCB RR, in case the SvcParamKeys "edhocpath" and "edhoc-app-prof", if present, do not comply with the format and restrictions defined above.

# Well-known EDHOC Application Profiles # {#sec-well-known-app-profiles}

This section defines a set of well-known EDHOC application profiles that are meant to reflect what is most common and expected to be supported by EDHOC peers.

The well-known application profiles are *not* to be intended as "default" profiles to use, in case no other indication is provided to EDHOC peers.

In particular, an EDHOC peer MUST NOT assume that, unless otherwise indicated, any of such profiles is used when running EDHOC through a well-known EDHOC resource, such as the resource at /.well-known/edhoc when EDHOC messages are transported as payload of CoAP messages (see {{Section A.2 of RFC9528}}).

Building on the above, the well-known application profiles are *not* intended to deviate from what is mandatory to support for EDHOC peers, which is defined by the compliance requirements in {{Section 8 of RFC9528}}.

The rest of this section defines the well-known application profiles, each of which is represented by means of an EDHOC_Application_Profile object (see {{sec-app-profile-cbor}}) using the CBOR extended diagnostic notation.

An entry for each well-known application profile is also registered at the "EDHOC Application Profiles" registry defined in {{iana-edhoc-application-profiles}} of this document.

## EDHOC Application Profiles Registry ## {#iana-edhoc-application-profiles}

IANA is requested to create a new "EDHOC Application Profiles" registry within the "Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC)" registry group defined in {{RFC9528}}.

The registration policy is either "Private Use", "Standards Action with Expert Review", or "Specification Required" per {{Section 4.6 of RFC8126}}. "Expert Review" guidelines are provided in {{iana-expert-review}}.

All assignments according to "Standards Action with Expert Review" are made on a "Standards Action" basis per {{Section 4.9 of RFC8126}}, with Expert Review additionally required per {{Section 4.5 of RFC8126}}. The procedure for early IANA allocation of Standards Track code points defined in {{RFC7120}} also applies. When such a procedure is used, IANA will ask the designated expert(s) to approve the early allocation before registration. In addition, WG chairs are encouraged to consult the expert(s) early during the process outlined in {{Section 3.1 of RFC7120}}.

The columns of this registry are:

* Profile ID: This field contains the value used to identify the EDHOC application profile. These values MUST be unique. The value can be a positive integer or a negative integer. Different ranges of values use different registration policies {{RFC8126}}. Integer values from -24 to 23 are designated as "Standards Action With Expert Review". Integer values from -65536 to -25 and from 24 to 65535 are designated as "Specification Required". Integer values smaller than -65536 and greater than 65535 are marked as "Private Use".

* Name: This field contains the name of the EDHOC application profile.

* Description: This field contains a short description of the EDHOC application profile.

* Reference: This field contains a pointer to the public specification for the EDHOC application profile.

This registry has been initially populated with the values in {{table-edhoc-well-known-app-profiles}}.

## Expert Review Instructions ## {#iana-expert-review}

"Standards Action with Expert Review" and "Specification Required" are two of the registration policies defined for the IANA registry established in this document. This section gives some general guidelines for what the experts should be looking for, but they are being designated as experts for a reason so they should be given substantial latitude.

Expert reviewers should take into consideration the following points:

* Clarity and correctness of registrations. Experts are expected to check the clarity of purpose and use of the requested entries. Experts need to make sure that the object of registration is clearly defined in the corresponding specification. Entries that do not meet these objective of clarity and completeness must not be registered.

* Point squatting should be discouraged. Reviewers are encouraged to get sufficient information for registration requests to ensure that the usage is not going to duplicate one that is already registered and that the point is likely to be used in deployments. The zones tagged as "Private Use" are intended for testing purposes and closed environments. Code points in other ranges should not be assigned for testing.

* Specifications are required for the "Standards Action With Expert Review" range of point assignment. Specifications should exist for "Specification Required" ranges, but early assignment before a specification is available is considered to be permissible. When specifications are not provided, the description provided needs to have sufficient information to identify what the point is being used for.

* Experts should take into account the expected usage of fields when approving point assignment. Documents published via Standards Action can also register points outside the Standards Action range. The length of the encoded value should be weighed against how many code points of that length are left, the size of device it will be used on, and the number of code points left that encode to that size.

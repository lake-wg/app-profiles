                  draft-ietf-lake-app-profiles-latest

Abstract

   The lightweight authenticated key exchange protocol Ephemeral Diffie-
   Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC) requires certain parameters to be agreed
   out-of-band, in order to ensure its successful completion.  To this
   end, application profiles specify the intended use of EDHOC to allow
   for the relevant processing and verifications to be made.  This
   document defines a number of means to coordinate the use and
   discovery of EDHOC application profiles.  Also, it defines a
   canonical, CBOR-based representation that can be used to describe,
   distribute, and store EDHOC application profiles.  Finally, this
   document defines a set of well-known EDHOC application profiles.

1.  Introduction

   Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC) [RFC9528] is a lightweight
   authenticated key exchange protocol, especially intended for use in
   constrained scenarios.

   In order to successfully run EDHOC, the two peers acting as Initiator
   and Responder have to agree on certain parameters.  Some of those are
   in-band and communicated through the protocol execution, during which
   a few of them may even be negotiated.  However, other parameters have
   to be known out-of-band, before running the EDHOC protocol.

   As discussed in Section 3.9 of [RFC9528], applications can use EDHOC
   application profiles, which specify the intended usage of EDHOC to
   allow for the relevant processing and verifications to be made.  In
   particular, an EDHOC application profile may include both in-band and
   out-of-band parameters.

   This document defines a number of means to coordinate the use and
   discovery of EDHOC application profiles, that is:

   *  The new IANA registry "EDHOC Application Profiles" defined in
      Section 11.5, where to register integer identifiers of EDHOC
      application profiles to use as corresponding Profile IDs.

   *  The new parameter "ed-prof" defined in Section 2.1.  This
      parameter is employed to specify an EDHOC application profile
      identified by its Profile ID, and can be used as target attribute
      in a web link [RFC8288] to an EDHOC resource, or as filter
      criteria in a discovery request to discover EDHOC resources.

      For instance, the target attribute can be used in a link-format
      document [RFC6690] describing EDHOC resources at a server, when
      EDHOC is transferred over CoAP [RFC7252] (see Appendix A.2 of
      [RFC9528] as well as [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-edhoc]).

   *  The new parameter "app_prof" defined in Section 2.2 for the
      EDHOC_Information object specified in
      [I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile].  This parameter is employed
      to specify a set of EDHOC application profiles, each identified by
      its Profile ID.

      For instance, the parameter can be used in the EDHOC and OSCORE
      profile [I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile] of the ACE framework
      for authentication and authorization in constrained environments
      (ACE) [RFC9200], in order to indicate the EDHOC application
      profiles supported by an ACE resource server.

   *  Additional parameters that provide information about an EDHOC
      application profile.  A subset of these parameters are to be used
      as target attributes in a web link to an EDHOC resource, or as
      filter criteria in a discovery request to discover EDHOC resources
      (see Section 3).  Another subset of these parameters are to be
      used as elements of the EDHOC_Information object (see Section 4).

   In order to ensure the applicability of such parameters beyond
   transport- or setup-specific scenarios, this document also defines a
   canonical, CBOR-based representation that can be used to describe,
   distribute, and store EDHOC application profiles as CBOR data items
   (see Section 5).  The defined representation is transport- and setup-
   independent, and avoids the need to reinvent an encoding for the
   available options to run the EDHOC protocol or the selection logic to
   apply on those.

   The CBOR-based representation of an EDHOC application profile can be,
   for example: retrieved as a result of a discovery process; or
   retrieved/provided during the retrieval/provisioning of an EDHOC
   peer's public authentication credential; or obtained during the
   execution of a device on-boarding/registration workflow.

   Finally, this document defines a set of well-known EDHOC application
   profiles (see Section 6).  These application profiles are meant to
   reflect what is most common and expected to be supported by EDHOC
   peers, while they are not to be intended as "default" application
   profiles or as a deviation from what is mandatory to support for
   EDHOC peers (see Section 8 of [RFC9528]).

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The reader is expected to be familiar with terms and concepts defined
   in EDHOC [RFC9528], and with the use of EDHOC with CoAP [RFC7252] and
   OSCORE [RFC8613] defined in [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-edhoc].

   Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) [RFC8949] and Concise
   Data Definition Language (CDDL) [RFC8610] are used in this document.
   CDDL predefined type names, especially bstr for CBOR byte strings and
   tstr for CBOR text strings, are used extensively in this document.

   CBOR data items are represented using the CBOR extended diagnostic
   notation as defined in Section 8 of [RFC8949] and Appendix G of
   [RFC8610] ("diagnostic notation").  Diagnostic notation comments are
   used to provide a textual representation of the parameters' keys and
   values.

   In the CBOR diagnostic notation used in this document, constructs of
   the form e'SOME_NAME' are replaced by the value assigned to SOME_NAME
   in the CDDL model shown in Figure 2 of Appendix A.  For example,
   {e'methods' : [0, 1, 2, 3], e'cipher_suites': 3} stands for {1 : [0,
   1, 2, 3], 2 : 3}.

   Note to RFC Editor: Please delete the paragraph immediately preceding
   this note.  Also, in the CBOR diagnostic notation used in this
   document, please replace the constructs of the form e'SOME_NAME' with
   the value assigned to SOME_NAME in the CDDL model shown in Figure 2
   of Appendix A.  Finally, please delete this note.

2.  Identifying EDHOC Application Profiles by Profile ID

   This section defines two means to identify EDHOC application profiles
   by their Profile IDs, i.e., the parameter "ed-prof" for web linking
   (see Section 2.1) and the parameter "app_prof" of the
   EDHOC_Information object (see Section 2.2).

2.1.  Web Linking

   Section 6 of [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-edhoc] defines a number of target
   attributes that can be used in a web link [RFC8288] with resource
   type "core.edhoc" (see Section 10.10 of [RFC9528]).  This is the
   case, e.g., when using a link-format document [RFC6690] describing
   EDHOC resources at a server, when EDHOC is transferred over CoAP
   [RFC7252] as defined in Appendix A.2 of [RFC9528].  This allows a
   client to obtain relevant information about the EDHOC application
   profile(s) to be used with a certain EDHOC resource.

   In the same spirit, this section defines the following additional
   parameter, which can be optionally specified as a target attribute
   with the same name in the link to the respective EDHOC resource, or
   among the filter criteria in a discovery request from a client.

   *  'ed-prof', specifying an EDHOC application profile supported by
      the server.  This parameter MUST specify a single value, which is
      taken from the 'Profile ID' column of the "EDHOC Application
      Profiles" registry defined in Section 11.5 of this document.  This
      parameter MAY occur multiple times, with each occurrence
      specifying an EDHOC application profile.

   When specifying the parameter 'ed-prof' in a link to an EDHOC
   resource, the target attribute rt="core.edhoc" MUST be included.

   If a link to an EDHOC resource includes occurrences of the target
   attribute 'ed-prof', then the following applies.

   *  The link MUST NOT include other target attributes that provide
      information about an EDHOC application profile (see, e.g.,
      Section 6 of [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-edhoc] and Section 3 of this
      document), with the exception of the target attribute 'ed-ead'
      that MAY be included.

      The recipient MUST ignore other target attributes that provide
      information about an EDHOC application profile, with the exception
      of the target attribute 'ed-ead'.

   *  If the link includes occurrences of the target attribute 'ed-ead',
      the link provides the following information: when using the target
      EDHOC resource as per the EDHOC application profile indicated by
      any occurrence of the target attribute 'ed-prof', the server
      supports the EAD items that are specified in the definition of
      that EDHOC application profile, as well as the EAD items indicated
      by the occurrences of the target attribute 'ed-ead'.

   The example in Figure 1 shows how a CoAP client discovers two EDHOC
   resources at a CoAP server, and obtains information about the
   application profile corresponding to each of those resources.  The
   Link Format notation from Section 5 of [RFC6690] is used.

   The example assumes the existence of an EDHOC application profile
   identified by the integer Profile ID 500, which is supported by the
   EDHOC resource at /edhoc-alt and whose definition includes the
   support for the EAD items with EAD label 111 and 222.

   Therefore, the link to the EDHOC resource at /edhoc-alt indicates
   that, when using that EDHOC resource as per the EDHOC application
   profile with Profile ID 500, the server supports the EAD items with
   EAD label 111, 222, and 333.

                          Figure 1: The Web Link.

2.2.  EDHOC_Information Object

   Section 3.4 of [I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile] defines the
   EDHOC_Information object, as including information that guides two
   peers towards executing the EDHOC protocol, and defines an initial
   set of its parameters.

   This document defines the new parameter "app_prof" of the
   EDHOC_Information object, as summarized in Table 1 and described
   further below.

   +==========+=======+========+===================+===================+
   | Name     | CBOR  | CBOR   | Registry          | Description       |
   |          | label | type   |                   |                   |
   +==========+=======+========+===================+===================+
   | app_prof | 18    | int    | EDHOC Application | Set of supported  |
   |          |       | or     | Profiles Registry | EDHOC Application |
   |          |       | array  |                   | Profiles          |
   +----------+-------+--------+-------------------+-------------------+

              Table 1: EDHOC_Information Parameter "app_prof"

   *  app_prof: This parameter specifies a set of supported EDHOC
      application profiles, identified by their Profile ID.  If the set
      is composed of a single EDHOC application profile, its Profile ID
      is encoded as an integer.  Otherwise, the set is encoded as an
      array of integers, where each array element encodes one Profile
      ID.  In JSON, the "app_prof" value is an integer or an array of
      integers.  In CBOR, "app_prof" is an integer or an array of
      integers, and has label 18.  The integer values are taken from the
      'Profile ID' column of the "EDHOC Application Profiles" registry
      defined in Section 11.5 of this document.

2.2.1.  Use in the EDHOC and OSCORE Profile of the ACE Framework

   Section 3 of [I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile] defines how the
   EDHOC_Information object can be used within the workflow of the EDHOC
   and OSCORE transport profile of the ACE framework for authentication
   and authorization in constrained environments (ACE) [RFC9200].

   In particular, the AS-to-C Access Token Response includes the
   parameter "edhoc_info", with value an EDHOC_Information object.  This
   allows the ACE authorization server (AS) to provide the ACE client
   (C) with information about how to run the EDHOC protocol with the ACE
   resource server (RS) for which the access token is issued.

   Similarly, the access token includes the corresponding claim
   "edhoc_info", with value an EDHOC_Information object.  This allows
   the AS to provide the ACE RS with information about how to run the
   EDHOC protocol with the ACE client, according to the issued access
   token.

   In turn, the EDHOC_Information object can include the parameter
   "app_prof" defined in this document.  This parameter indicates a set
   of EDHOC application profiles associated with the EDHOC resource to
   use at the RS, which is either implied or specified by the parameter
   "uri_path" within the same EDHOC_Information object.

   If the EDHOC_Information object specified as value of "edhoc_info"
   includes the "app_prof" parameter, then the following applies.

   *  The object MUST NOT include other parameters that provide
      information pertaining to an EDHOC application profile, with the
      exception of the parameter "eads" that MAY be included.

      C and RS MUST ignore other parameters present in the
      EDHOC_Information object, with the exception of the parameter
      "eads".

      At the time of writing this document, such parameters are:
      "methods", "cipher_suites", "message_4", "comb_req", "osc_ms_len",
      "osc_salt_len", "osc_version", "cred_types", "id_cred_types",
      "initiator", and "responder" (which are all defined in Section 3.4
      of [I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile]), as well as those defined
      in Section 4 of this document.

   *  If the EDHOC_Information object specified in the parameter
      "edhoc_info" of the AS-to-C Access Token Response includes the
      parameter "eads", the object provides the following information.

      When using the target EDHOC resource as per any EDHOC application
      profile indicated by the parameter "app_prof", the ACE RS for
      which the access token is issued supports the EAD items that are
      specified in the definition of that EDHOC application profile, as
      well as the EAD items indicated by the parameter "eads".

   *  If the EDHOC_Information object specified in the claim
      "edhoc_info" of the access token includes the parameter "eads",
      the object provides the following information.

      When using the target EDHOC resource as per any EDHOC application
      profile indicated by the parameter "app_prof", the ACE client to
      which the access token is issued supports the EAD items that are
      specified in the definition of that EDHOC application profile, as
      well as the EAD items indicated by the parameter "eads".

3.  Additional Parameters for Web Linking

   Building on what is defined and prescribed in Section 6 of
   [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-edhoc], this section defines additional
   parameters for web linking [RFC8288], which can be used to obtain
   relevant pieces of information from the EDHOC application profile
   associated with an EDHOC resource.

   These parameters can be optionally specified as target attributes
   with the same name in a link with resource type "core.edhoc" (see
   Section 10.10 of [RFC9528]) targeting an EDHOC resource, or as filter
   criteria in a discovery request from a client.

   When specifying any of the parameters defined below in a link to an
   EDHOC resource, the target attribute rt="core.edhoc" MUST be
   included.

   *  'ed-max-msgsize', specifying the admitted maximum size of EDHOC
      messages in bytes.  This parameter MUST specify a single unsigned
      integer value.

   *  'ed-coap-cf', specifying that CoAP messages have to include the
      CoAP Content-Format Option with value 64 (application/edhoc+cbor-
      seq) or 65 (application/cid-edhoc+cbor-seq) as appropriate, when
      the message payload includes exclusively an EDHOC message possibly
      prepended by an EDHOC connection identifier (see Sections 3.4.1
      and A.2 of [RFC9528]).  A value MUST NOT be given to this
      parameter and any present value MUST be ignored by the recipient.

   *  'ed-idep-t', specifying a type of endpoint identity for EDHOC
      supported by the server.  This parameter MUST specify a single
      value, which is taken from the 'CBOR Label' column of the "EDHOC
      Endpoint Identity Types" Registry defined in Section 8 of this
      document.  This parameter MAY occur multiple times, with each
      occurrence specifying a type of endpoint identity for EDHOC.

   *  'ed-tp', specifying a means for transporting EDHOC messages
      supported by the server.  This parameter MUST specify a single
      value, which is taken from the 'Transport ID' column of the "EDHOC
      Transports" Registry defined in Section 9 of this document.  This
      parameter MAY occur multiple times, with each occurrence
      specifying a means for transporting EDHOC messages.

4.  Additional Parameters of the EDHOC_Information Object

   This section defines additional parameters of the EDHOC_Information
   object defined in Section 3.4 of [I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile].
   These parameters are summarized in Table 2 and described further
   below.

   Editor's note: these parameters can better be defined directly in
   Section 3.4 of [I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile].

                  Table 2: EDHOC_Information Parameters

   *  max_msgsize: This parameter specifies the admitted maximum size of
      EDHOC messages in bytes.  In JSON, the "max_msgsize" value is an
      unsigned integer.  In CBOR, "max_msgsize" is an unsigned integer
      and has label 14.

   *  coap_cf: This parameter specifies whether it is required that CoAP
      messages include the CoAP Content-Format Option with value 64
      (application/edhoc+cbor-seq) or 65 (application/cid-edhoc+cbor-
      seq) as appropriate, when the message payload includes exclusively
      an EDHOC message possibly prepended by an EDHOC connection
      identifier (see Sections 3.4.1 and A.2 of [RFC9528]).  In JSON,
      the "coap_cf" value is a boolean.  In CBOR, "coap_cf" is the
      simple value true (0xf5) or false (0xf4), and has label 15.

   *  id_ep_types: This parameter specifies a set of supported types of
      endpoint identities for EDHOC.  If the set is composed of a single
      type of endpoint identity, this is encoded as an integer.
      Otherwise, the set is encoded as an array, where each array
      element encodes one type of endpoint identity as an integer.  In
      JSON, the "id_ep_types" value is an integer or an array of
      integers.  In CBOR, "id_ep_types" is an integer or an array of
      integers, and has label 16.  The integer values are taken from the
      'CBOR Label' column of the "EDHOC Endpoint Identity Types"
      registry defined in Section 11.6 of this document.

   *  transports: This parameter specifies a set of supported means for
      transporting EDHOC messages.  If the set is composed of a single
      means for transporting EDHOC messages, this is encoded as an
      integer.  Otherwise, the set is encoded as an array, where each
      array element encodes one means for transporting EDHOC messages as
      an integer.  In JSON, the "transports" value is an integer or an
      array of integers.  In CBOR, "transports" is an integer or an
      array of integers, and has label 17.  The integer values are taken
      from the 'Transport ID' column of the "EDHOC Transports" Registry
      defined in Section 9 of this document.

5.  Representation of an EDHOC Application Profile

   This section defines the EDHOC_Application_Profile object, which can
   be used as a canonical representation of EDHOC application profiles
   for their description, distribution, and storage.

   An EDHOC_Application_Profile object is encoded as a CBOR map
   [RFC8949].  Each element of the CBOR map is an element of the CBOR-
   encoded EDHOC_Information object defined in Section 3.4 of
   [I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile], and thus uses the corresponding
   CBOR abbreviations from the 'CBOR label' column of the "EDHOC
   Information" registry defined in [I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile].

   The CBOR map encoding an EDHOC_Application_Profile object MUST
   include the element "app_prof" defined in this document.  The value
   of the element "app_prof" is the unique identifier of the EDHOC
   application profile described by the EDHOC_Application_Profile
   object, taken from the 'Profile ID' column of the "EDHOC Application
   Profiles" registry defined in this document, and encoded as a CBOR
   integer.

   The CBOR map MUST include the following elements defined for the
   EDHOC_Information object: "methods" and "cred_types".

   The CBOR map MUST NOT include the following elements defined for the
   EDHOC_Information object: "session_id", "uri_path", "initiator", and
   "responder".

   The CBOR map MAY include other elements defined for the
   EDHOC_Information object.  These also comprise the new parameters
   defined in Section 4 of this document.

   Furthermore, consistent with Sections 8 and A.1 of [RFC9528] and with
   Section 5.4 of [RFC8613], the following applies:

   *  If the element "cipher_suites" is not present in the CBOR map,
      this indicates that the EDHOC application profile uses the EDHOC
      cipher suites 2 and 3.

   *  If the element "id_cred_types" is not present in the CBOR map,
      this indicates that the EDHOC application profile uses "kid" as
      type of authentication credential identifiers for EDHOC.

   *  If the element "osc_ms_len" is not present in the CBOR map, this
      indicates that, when using EDHOC to key OSCORE [RFC8613], the size
      of the OSCORE Master Secret in bytes is equal to the size of the
      key length for the application AEAD Algorithm of the selected
      cipher suite for the EDHOC session.

   *  If the element "osc_salt_len" is not present in the CBOR map, this
      indicates that, when using EDHOC to key OSCORE, the size of the
      OSCORE Master Salt in bytes is 8.

   *  If the element "osc_version" is not present in the CBOR map, this
      indicates that, when using EDHOC to key OSCORE, the OSCORE Version
      Number has value 1.

   *  The absence of any other elements in the CBOR map MUST NOT result
      in assuming any value.

   If an element is present in the CBOR map and the information that it
   specifies is intrinsically a set of one or more co-existing
   alternatives, then all the specified alternatives apply for the EDHOC
   application profile in question.

   For example, the element "cipher_suites" with value the CBOR array
   [0, 2] means that, in order to adhere to the EDHOC application
   profile in question, an EDHOC peer has to implement both the EDHOC
   cipher suites 0 and 2, because either of them can be used by another
   EDHOC peer also adhering to the same EDHOC application profile.

   The CDDL grammar describing the EDHOC_Application_Profile object is:

   EDHOC_Application_Profile = {
         1 => int / array,    ; methods
         9 => int / array,    ; cred_types
        18 => int,            ; app_prof
      * int / tstr => any
   }

6.  Well-known EDHOC Application Profiles

   This section defines a set of well-known EDHOC application profiles
   that are meant to reflect what is most common and expected to be
   supported by EDHOC peers.

   The well-known application profiles are _not_ to be intended as
   "default" profiles to use, in case no other indication is provided to
   EDHOC peers.

   In particular, an EDHOC peer MUST NOT assume that, unless otherwise
   indicated, any of such profiles is used when running EDHOC through a
   well-known EDHOC resource, such as the resource at /.well-known/edhoc
   when EDHOC messages are transported as payload of CoAP messages (see
   Appendix A.2 of [RFC9528]).

   Building on the above, the well-known application profiles are _not_
   intended to deviate from what is mandatory to support for EDHOC
   peers, which is defined by the compliance requirements in Section 8
   of [RFC9528].

   The rest of this section defines the well-known application profiles,
   each of which is represented by means of an EDHOC_Application_Profile
   object (see Section 5) using the CBOR extended diagnostic notation.

   An entry for each well-known application profile is also registered
   at the "EDHOC Application Profiles" registry defined in Section 11.5
   of this document.

11.5.  EDHOC Application Profiles Registry

   IANA is requested to create a new "EDHOC Application Profiles"
   registry within the "Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC)"
   registry group defined in [RFC9528].

   The registration policy is either "Private Use", "Standards Action
   with Expert Review", or "Specification Required" per Section 4.6 of
   [RFC8126].  "Expert Review" guidelines are provided in Section 11.8.

   All assignments according to "Standards Action with Expert Review"
   are made on a "Standards Action" basis per Section 4.9 of [RFC8126],
   with Expert Review additionally required per Section 4.5 of
   [RFC8126].  The procedure for early IANA allocation of Standards
   Track code points defined in [RFC7120] also applies.  When such a
   procedure is used, IANA will ask the designated expert(s) to approve
   the early allocation before registration.  In addition, WG chairs are
   encouraged to consult the expert(s) early during the process outlined
   in Section 3.1 of [RFC7120].

   The columns of this registry are:

   *  Profile ID: This field contains the value used to identify the
      EDHOC application profile.  These values MUST be unique.  The
      value can be a positive integer or a negative integer.  Different
      ranges of values use different registration policies [RFC8126].
      Integer values from -24 to 23 are designated as "Standards Action
      With Expert Review".  Integer values from -65536 to -25 and from
      24 to 65535 are designated as "Specification Required".  Integer
      values smaller than -65536 and greater than 65535 are marked as
      "Private Use".

   *  Name: This field contains the name of the EDHOC application
      profile.

   *  Description: This field contains a short description of the EDHOC
      application profile.

   *  Reference: This field contains a pointer to the public
      specification for the EDHOC application profile.

   This registry has been initially populated with the values in
   Table 3.

11.6.  EDHOC Endpoint Identity Types Registry

   IANA is requested to create a new "EDHOC Endpoint Identity Types"
   registry within the "Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC)"
   registry group defined in [RFC9528].

   The registration policy is either "Private Use", "Standards Action
   with Expert Review", or "Specification Required" per Section 4.6 of
   [RFC8126].  "Expert Review" guidelines are provided in Section 11.8.

   All assignments according to "Standards Action with Expert Review"
   are made on a "Standards Action" basis per Section 4.9 of [RFC8126],

   the early allocation before registration.  In addition, WG chairs are
   encouraged to consult the expert(s) early during the process outlined
   in Section 3.1 of [RFC7120].

   The columns of this registry are:

   *  Name: This field contains the name of the EDHOC endpoint identity
      type.

   *  CBOR Label: The value to be used to identify this EDHOC endpoint
      identity type.  These values MUST be unique.  The value can be a
      positive integer or a negative integer.  Different ranges of
      values use different registration policies [RFC8126].  Integer
      values from -24 to 23 are designated as "Standards Action With
      Expert Review".  Integer values from -65536 to -25 and from 24 to
      65535 are designated as "Specification Required".  Integer values
      smaller than -65536 and greater than 65535 are marked as "Private
      Use".

   *  Description: This field contains a short description of the EDHOC
      endpoint identity type.

      specification for the means used for transporting EDHOC messages.

   This registry has been initially populated with the values in
   Table 5.

11.8.  Expert Review Instructions

   "Standards Action with Expert Review" and "Specification Required"
   are two of the registration policies defined for the IANA registries
   established in this document.  This section gives some general
   guidelines for what the experts should be looking for, but they are
   being designated as experts for a reason so they should be given
   substantial latitude.

   Expert reviewers should take into consideration the following points:

   *  Clarity and correctness of registrations.  Experts are expected to
      check the clarity of purpose and use of the requested entries.
      Experts need to make sure that the object of registration (i.e.,
      an EDHOC application profile, an EDHOC endpoint identity type, or
      a means for transporting EDHOC messages) is clearly defined in the
      corresponding specification.  Entries that do not meet these
      objective of clarity and completeness must not be registered.

   *  Point squatting should be discouraged.  Reviewers are encouraged
      to get sufficient information for registration requests to ensure
      that the usage is not going to duplicate one that is already
      registered and that the point is likely to be used in deployments.
      The zones tagged as "Private Use" are intended for testing
      purposes and closed environments.  Code points in other ranges
      should not be assigned for testing.

   *  Specifications are required for the "Standards Action With Expert
      Review" range of point assignment.  Specifications should exist
      for "Specification Required" ranges, but early assignment before a
      specification is available is considered to be permissible.  When
      specifications are not provided, the description provided needs to
      have sufficient information to identify what the point is being
      used for.

   *  Experts should take into account the expected usage of fields when
      approving point assignment.  Documents published via Standards
      Action can also register points outside the Standards Action
      range.  The length of the encoded value should be weighed against
      how many code points of that length are left, the size of device
      it will be used on, and the number of code points left that encode
      to that size.
